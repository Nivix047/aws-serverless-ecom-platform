# AWS RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, Honeycode, CI/CD Project

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to deploy a professional, scalable, and secure architecture using AWS services for database management, backend logic, frontend data entry, and automated infrastructure deployment. This project will **NOT use Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IAC). Instead, it will focus on manual deployment to gain hands-on experience with AWS services. A future project will include Terraform to automate these deployments.

## Key Components

### 1. **AWS RDS** (Relational Database Service)

- **Purpose**: To host and manage the database with scalability, backups, and durability.
- **Database**: Postgres deployed via RDS.
- **Security**: Utilize VPC, subnets, and security groups to ensure the database is not publicly accessible. IAM roles will manage secure access.

### 2. **AWS Lambda**

- **Purpose**: Serve as the backend for executing serverless logic.
- **Usage**: Lambda functions will process API requests (via API Gateway) and interact with the RDS database.
- **Key Benefits**: Scalability and a pay-per-execution model optimize costs.

### 3. **AWS API Gateway**

- **Purpose**: Expose Lambda functions as REST APIs for external or internal use.
- **Security**: Implement API authentication and authorization using AWS IAM roles or API keys.
- **Endpoints**: Create API endpoints for frontend data submission, retrieval, and modification operations.

### 4. **AWS Honeycode** (Frontend)

- **Purpose**: Provide a low-code/no-code interface for admins, salespeople, or users to interact with the system.
- **Usage**: Create forms and interfaces to input customer data and view reports.
- **Integration**: Communicate with API Gateway to push and pull data via Lambda functions.

### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline** (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

- **Purpose**: Automate code deployment to Lambda functions and ensure efficient updates.
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Steps**:
  1. Code changes trigger the pipeline.
  2. Lambda and API Gateway updates are deployed.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests are executed before deployment to ensure quality.

### 6. **Containers**

- **Purpose**: Provide isolated environments for development and QA.
- **Docker**: Used for local development, testing, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

### 7. **QA Tools**

- **Code Quality**: Utilize **SonarQube** or **Pylint** for Python code analysis.
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests with **Pytest** for Lambda functions and integration tests for API Gateway endpoints.
- **Load Testing**: Tools like **Postman** or **k6** for API testing and performance benchmarks.

## Project Workflow

1. **Development**:

   - **Local Development**: Use Docker containers for local development environments.
   - **Code Management**: Version control with Git, with branches for feature development, testing, and production releases.

2. **Infrastructure Deployment**:

   - **Manual AWS Deployment**: All AWS resources (RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.) will be manually deployed through the AWS Management Console.

3. **Database Management**:

   - **Postgres in RDS**: Automated backups and scaling for the database.
   - **API Communication**: Lambda functions will execute SQL queries and updates to RDS via API Gateway.

4. **Frontend**:
   - **AWS Honeycode**: Provides a GUI for users to submit and view data.
   - **API Integration**: Calls are made to API Gateway to interact with the backend.

## Scalability and Best Practices

- **Security**:

  - Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for granular permissions.
  - Encrypt data at rest (RDS encryption) and in transit (TLS for API Gateway).

- **Scalability**:

  - Lambda functions automatically scale based on demand.
  - RDS can be configured for auto-scaling read replicas.

- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - **AWS CloudWatch**: Used to monitor Lambda execution, API Gateway performance, and RDS metrics.
  - **Alerts**: Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify about threshold breaches (e.g., high error rates, slow query times).

## Next Steps

1. **Set Up Initial Infrastructure**:

   - Manually create RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, and necessary networking components via the AWS Management Console.

2. **Develop Lambda Functions**:

   - Build functions for handling CRUD operations with the RDS database.

3. **Create API Gateway Endpoints**:

   - Design REST API routes that integrate with Lambda functions.

4. **Build CI/CD Pipeline**:

   - Set up GitHub Actions (or an alternative) to automate Lambda function deployment upon new commits.

5. **Integrate QA**:

   - Integrate automated testing, linting, and static code analysis into the CI pipeline.

6. **Deploy Frontend with AWS Honeycode**:
   - Build forms and views for data input/output.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS RDS**: For relational database management (Postgres).
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless backend functions.
- **AWS API Gateway**: For exposing Lambda functions as RESTful APIs.
- **AWS Honeycode**: For creating frontend data entry forms.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Docker**: For containerization in development and testing environments.
- **QA Tools**: SonarQube, Pytest, Insomnia for quality assurance and testing.

## Future Enhancements

In the next project, Terraform will be introduced to manage infrastructure as code (IAC) to simplify deployments and ensure consistency across environments. For now, the focus is on understanding and mastering AWS services through manual deployments.
